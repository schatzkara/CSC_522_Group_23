19509,"SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Case for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 5G (2022), Full-Body Dual Layer Rugged Case with Built-in Screen Protector &amp; Kickstand &amp; S Pen Slot (Black)",Too bulky and interferes the front screen,2,"I love the fact that this case is very sturdy and will protect my phone from drops when scratches on the front screen. However, the front screen had to be uninstalled and reinstalled because you have to really push it all the way into the phone or it's a little bit off center from the camera. Even when it's properly installed, the front protector screen interferes with the keyboard when using the front screen. It is very difficult to get to the letters along the left side of the keyboard unless I use my pinky and sort of angle it in. Other than that, the front screen does not interfere with operating with the finger and selecting items on the screen. The hinge is great for protecting, but when I put the S-pen in the first time it was really tight. That lasted all of about 5 hours. Now the s-pen is secure but I worry that if the hinge opens it's going to fall out because it's not as tight as it was in the beginning. Well bulky, the case isn't really heavy. But it does bulge in my back pocket and take up a lot of space. I'm debating whether or not to get a more streamlined case that is in his bulky. and while the stand is very secure compared to the Samsung built-in stand, it will only stand the phone in one direction. And many apps have not yet been optimized for the fold 4 so they won't rotate in tablet mode. When that happens the stand is in the wrong position and it cannot be used.",-1,0

UPDATED! “Please read” I called apple support about the issue and to my surprise they were quick to warranty the case and took for responsibility of it being a factory flaw. I was supposed to have a new replacement shipped within the next couple of business days. Well that was almost 2 months ago. I got a tracking number the very next day, but still months later it still says waiting on product to arrive to be shipped. I called apple about this and broke the whole story down for 5, repeat 5 different people there that each thought they could handle it but never could. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 48 mins for nothing. The last person that was going to transfer me hung up after all that time.

I like how the circle mag emblem is a different color other than white. The cameras have a lip that protects them from damage if placed on a flat table; but, if you have the phone in your pocket or an un flat table, the lip won’t protect the lenses. I still like it though and recommend it. The buttons work great and the speaker cut outs align well. It has no grips like my $5 case but the rubbery exterior offers pretty good grip though not as much grip as my $5 case that has plastic grips that are very effective, more so than the rubber material on this unit. But I still like the look of this one more.Update: Jan 24, 23 - my phone fell three feet, slipped out of my hand...back of my iPhone shattered. this case isn't good for protection. get a case with fusion if you value your phone!!

I thought that if it did fall apart it would be months, but 5 days?  This is totally unacceptable for $49+.  Also, I purchased this as a replacement to the Apple Magsafe clear case that I had for 3 months (that one took a tumble and shattered at the corners and inexplicably bent around the volume buttons, rendering it unusable--it did protect the phone!).

I’ve never had this issue even with the cheaper China cases I’ve had. It really takes away from what is a well designed sleek case. Hopefully Apple will fix this problem in future cases. UPDATED! “Please read” I called apple support about the issue and to my surprise they were quick to warranty the case and took for responsibility of it being a factory flaw. I was supposed to have a new replacement shipped within the next couple of business days. Well that was almost 2 months ago. I got a tracking number the very next day, but still months later it still says waiting on product to arrive to be shipped. I called apple about this and broke the whole story down for 5, repeat 5 different people there that each thought they could handle it but never could. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 48 mins for nothing. The last person that was going to transfer me hung up after all that time.

The case appeared snug over the front display and the rear cameras.  Although it was a bit heavy I would bear it for the features it offered.However, within a couple of weeks I noticed an air gap on the front display screen.  Although disconcerting I was ok as the screen is backlit  - it is only now after I replaced the case with an ESR case and only a screen protector that I realize how much the Temdan case was affecting the display ;-(The most troubling aspect was the air gap appearing on the rear side over the lenses.  While iPhone lenses do have the flare issue, the Temdan case yields multiple flares in direct light..  (I would press down over the lens cover to clear the air gap but it would reappear shortly.) I took pics with my iPhone 11 Pro for comparison and that’s when I realized how badly the Temdon case was affecting the image quality in general.Then there is the muffled audio.  My friends complained of my muffled voice during chats.  Also, the video recordings were being affected by the Temdan case.Remedy: I bought an ESR case (not waterproof).  Temdan instructions want you to remove any screen protectors to give a tight fit.  But the air gap that appears does injustice to the excellent iPhone 14 Pro Display.  I installed a new screen protector and with the new case and no covers over the lenses (I am willing to take the risk) I am enjoying the great iPhone 14 pro camera features.If you care about photography then avoid the Temdon case.",-1,0

I’m not sure how this one got screwed up so royally. You simply can’t push the buttons in without a lot of effort, if you can even locate where to press them.To make matters even more confusing, my wife got the same exact case a couple weeks earlier and not only were the buttons easily accessible and easily pushed, but it seemed like a differently designed case in other sections as well.The whole issue defies logic.

I could tell as soon as it arrived how loose and wiggly the yellow button pieces are, but I wasn’t expecting top tier quality case at this price anyway so I just went with it, but this was ridiculous. I didn’t drop it or anything; I just was driving my car for an hour, got out, tried to lock my phone, and suddenly realized the lock button piece was gone. Because of how thick the case is, it’s now incredibly difficult to press the lock button without turning my phone to the side and carefully pressing my nail into the hole, something that becomes very annoying very quickly considering how many times a day we all lock our phones. If you’re like me and just looking for a cheap case to use temporarily, there are plenty of other $10-15 cases that are much more durable—aka ones that don’t have these loose volume/lock buttons, but rather buttons that are part of the case as one whole piece—so save yourself the hassle and just get one of those!

The two screen protector is a gimmick.,2,"I’m really surprised reviews on this are so high. I would return it and go back to my old, rubbery, yellowing case if I hadn’t tossed it when this arrived. I might replace it anyways.Pros:definitely sturdy/hard plasticCons:—Has instantly bubbled 3 different kinds of screen protectors. The ones they send with it are trash.—is SO hard to take off/access your phone. I’m talking over 60 seconds of concerted effort to get it off. Then you’ve got three things in your hands—two piece case and your phone. I used to put cash/cards in the back of my case when I had no pockets etc. No more. Need to replace your SIM regularly, like when you’re traveling? Misery! More importantly, every time you take it off, micro cracks  appear in it!!! These will 100% evolve into a broken case shortly. It already looks really bad/rough.—the lock/unlock/Siri button is now *all but unusable*. It takes a ludicrous amount of force to trigger—usually it results in a screenshot as you need to use the other side of the phone to leverage it—similarly, it is *impossible* to switch the volume switch off and on with the case on...unless you have a 1cm fingernail trimmed like a dagger. Quickly toggling off volume when I’m getting blown up by text is a mainstay for me—it is impossible with this case! The cavity has to be almost 1cm deep. Really crazy design.—volume buttons are stiff, but not as terrible as the power/Siri button—top right corner of case has a tiny gap. And when it lets a little water in? You get to remove your case! One full minute to get it off, almost another to put it back on. Each time resulting in more micro cracks.Overall I’m disappointed I didn’t get the cheapest rubber case on the market. It’s like this thing was never tested by humans before going to market. I’m shopping for a replacement right now. I’m mad at myself and can’t believe reviews are so high.",-1,0

It was very hard to slide in and out of my pockets.I still broke down after hours of case shopping and bought one of these for my 12 Pro. I wanted a stylish option that would work with MagSafe. I have not been disappointed!I bought the green one and it's less rubbery and grippy than the one I had on my iPhone X. This means I can actually slide it in and out of my pocket fairly easily.MagSafe is great and I have enjoyed this sleek, minimalist case. Also provides a fair amount of drop protection.Admittedly the price is quite high, but if you bite the bullet I don't think you will be disappointed!Update: the silicone is peeling pretty bad after a little under a year. Harder to justify the price considering how poorly it ages. Reduced from 5 to 3 stars.Update 2: Contacted Apple Support to ask for a replacement. The support process took forever, I talked to four different people via text and phone. The first three people all told me they couldn't answer my question. The last guy just said no. What a waste of my time. Updated to two stars. Don't expect this case to last more than 8 months (even without drops), and don't expect a replacement from Apple.",-1,0

I have not been disappointed!I bought the green one and it's less rubbery and grippy than the one I had on my iPhone X. This means I can actually slide it in and out of my pocket fairly easily.MagSafe is great and I have enjoyed this sleek, minimalist case. Also provides a fair amount of drop protection.Admittedly the price is quite high, but if you bite the bullet I don't think you will be disappointed!Update: the silicone is peeling pretty bad after a little under a year. Harder to justify the price considering how poorly it ages. Reduced from 5 to 3 stars.Update 2: Contacted Apple Support to ask for a replacement. The support process took forever, I talked to four different people via text and phone. The first three people all told me they couldn't answer my question. The last guy just said no. What a waste of my time. Updated to two stars. Don't expect this case to last more than 8 months (even without drops), and don't expect a replacement from Apple.",-1,0

Video chatting and phone calls have presented tremendous difficulty with this case.Original 3* Review: Overall, this is a fine product for phone protection; however, I have 3 things I wish I knew before purchasing. First, the back of the case that covers the camera portion sticks out which makes it odd/bulky and, more importantly, inhibits the wireless charging ability of the case on some wireless chargers. Second, the design of the case to protect from water/dust muffles the sound when playing music. Last, the flap for the charging port is difficult to open. Otherwise, the case hasn't given any significant issues and we'll see if it holds up to bumps and spills!

You have to really use a lot of pressure with your finger to lift up the one corner that you’re supposed to use open up the case. You need a lot of effort because the case is super watertight.BUT, the glue that attaches the glass to the rubber border of the case in this corner isn’t strong enough to withstand the prying to open the case up. Yesterday, when I went to remove my phone from the case, the glue lost its hold and now the glass in the corner is no longer holding a water tight seal. In fact, the glass is completely separated from the rubber border on the opening corner.Huge design flaw. Don’t be fooled but this case’s initial good performance.

This isn’t product defect, it’s just poor salesman ship, product design and trying to gain the customer for profit. It’s sleazy. It’s wrong. And it’s shameful of Amazon to accept that the vendors can get away with this. If Amazon cared about the sales experience, instead of how easy is it to get a product returned (surveys), Amazon would hire an entire team that solely focuses on fact checking, removing ambiguous or misleading verbiage and product specifications, and guiding vendors on crafting a accurate and yet still marketable product description. This in turn would most likely take a sizeable bite out of the return rate and increase the customer satisfaction and items per purchase rate given the reduced time spent navigating descriptions and having to “translate” what is being represented and whether the customer should “risk it” or not.So, this is not MagSafe. It states wireless charging acceptable but wireless charging in the Apple world is not MagSafe. I can place my phone down on a wireless charging pad or a Qi pad and wireless charging occurs.  However,  a product represented and designed for iPhone 12/ 12 pro stating wireless charging, along with a representative photo depicting a green round circle “energy” transfer, with a iPhone overhead is intentionally misleading. This is NOT MagSafe. Not close. The minute I attempted to attach my Apple MagSafe wallet or battery, it fell right off.  There’s no ring on the back. Intentionally implying or misrepresenting a specification or feature is downright a lie and it’s plausible debiability that can be (sleazily) claimed.",-1,0

We have had other companies replace items that cost a fraction of the price without questions because they care.

Also provides a fair amount of drop protection.Admittedly the price is quite high, but if you bite the bullet I don't think you will be disappointed!Update: the silicone is peeling pretty bad after a little under a year. Harder to justify the price considering how poorly it ages. Reduced from 5 to 3 stars.Update 2: Contacted Apple Support to ask for a replacement. The support process took forever, I talked to four different people via text and phone. The first three people all told me they couldn't answer my question. The last guy just said no.

However, the front screen had to be uninstalled and reinstalled because you have to really push it all the way into the phone or it's a little bit off center from the camera. Even when it's properly installed, the front protector screen interferes with the keyboard when using the front screen. It is very difficult to get to the letters along the left side of the keyboard unless I use my pinky and sort of angle it in. Other than that, the front screen does not interfere with operating with the finger and selecting items on the screen. The hinge is great for protecting, but when I put the S-pen in the first time it was really tight. That lasted all of about 5 hours. Now the s-pen is secure but I worry that if the hinge opens it's going to fall out because it's not as tight as it was in the beginning. Well bulky, the case isn't really heavy. But it does bulge in my back pocket and take up a lot of space.

This is a solid case, however, its two main downfalls are how slippery it is to hold, and how easily it cracks. These two issues seem to feed into each other and I found the phone frequently, and easily, slipping out of my hand and cracking upon impact with the ground. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Apple case due to the premium materials and strong magnets, cosmetically, the case has become a nightmare. With these issues in consideration, not to mention the more expensive price, I no longer recommend the Apple clear case with magsafe.[RECOMMENDED CASE for iPhone 13 Pro Max]If anyone is looking for a case that is similar to this listing but has magsafe functionality, feels amazing to hold, and is extremely durable against fall damage, I highly recommend the case linked below:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DNWYB44/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This case is cheap and has alleviated ALL of the issues I encountered with the CASEKOO and Apple brand cases. This case is similar to the CASEKOO case in that it has soft plastic edges with a hard plastic backplate, however, the overall construction of the case is much thinner AND has magnets. Due to the thin design it is extremely pleasant to hold and the soft plastic sides of the case make it extremely easy to grip. This case makes my phone feel extremely solid and premium in my hand, and I have no doubts it will be able to withstand fall damage - unlike my apple case. If there is a con to point out with the new listing it may be that the magnets do not appear to be as strong as the ones found in my Apple case, but with that being said, magsafe is still functional across all of my accessories.CASE RANKINGS:1) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DNWYB44/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1(Best case overall, magsafe functionality, thin, durable, Brand: MP mypole)2) Apple Clear Case with Magsafe(most expensive, premium materials, fragile and does not withstand fall damage)3)CASEKOO(Does not support magsafe, thicker)*********ORIGINAL REVIEW (9/25/21)**********************Be careful if you buy this case as it does not work well with magsafe accessories. If you plan on using a magsafe car mount or charger such as the Belkin Boost 3-in-1, this case is NOT compatible. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is a heavy phone, and because this case does not have additional magnets the magnetic connection was extremely weak and my accessories were unable to support the weight of my new iPhone.Overall, the construction of the case is fairly nice. I like the hard plastic back plate, but it is prone to showing a lot of finger prints, even when using lighter variations of the phone such as the new Sierra Blue color. The soft plastic edges of the case are nice and they provide a bit of grip to the phone while maintaining the tactile feel of the buttons, but they also make it feel more bulky and cheap. Additionally, the pattern embedded into the soft plastic, along with the air cushions on the corners of the case obstruct the view of the stainless steel edges of the phone.I really wanted to love this case, and as soon as I unboxed my phone I immediately put it on. However, I was extremely disappointed to discover how poorly it worked with my new magsafe accessories. If magsafe is not important to you I think this is a cheap and solid buy, but it will mean you won't be getting the most out of your new investment.I just purchased the Apple Clear Case with Magsafe, and as soon as I started using it the difference in quality was immediately apparent. Though this case is more expensive ($49) I think it is well worth the money, and it is exactly what I was looking for. This case looks better, feels better, and is more functional. This case is constructed entirely out of hard plastic and shows absolutely no finger prints or smudges, and the additional magnets mean it works perfectly with my new accessories. Because of the hard plastic I don't think this case will hold up as well to drops, but it looks and feels amazing.",-1,0

22166,"Elando Crystal Clear Phone Case Compatible with iPhone 12/12 Pro, Non-Yellowing Shockproof Protective Phone Case Slim Thin, 6.1 inch",I just updated my original review I wrote way too soon! PLEASE READ,2,"Updated Review: I wrote the first review after about a week using this case. I even complimented it and the fact it was more of a rubbery, silicone-like material. So now I’ve had the case for over a month and noticed that the “power button” (button on the right side used to lock the screen, take screen shots, turn phone off, etc) wasn’t working. With the case on I couldn’t screenshot or turn my screen off before putting my phone down. I took the case off and noticed that side button was stuck in the “pushed” position to the point it was flush with the side of the phone. So I did what anyone would do and googled “stuck power button iPhone 12.” I immediately noticed this was a very common issue, even to people that only had the phone for a few weeks. There were recommendations on trying to clean it as if it got stuck because sticky goop got in there. That didn’t make sense to me because I’ve always had a case. I bought this case to replace the Apple made MagSafe case I had for over a year.Then I came across a link to Apple Support (or it may have been Reddit. I can’t remember). When I read from an Apple employee trying to explain the problem, they said that these rubber-like, silicone-style cases with rubber over the power button were the cause of the power button being “stuck.” You can clean it all day long, but after thousands of complaints they figured out these cases were causing pressure on the button and destroying the spring underneath that allowed the button to be pressed and come back out like it’s been designed to do since the iPhone 1. Those same people saying they only had the phone for a couple weeks were using this style of case. My button worked flawlessly while I had the MagSafe case. So that thread made a lot of sense since I changed cases and what the case was made from and after a month my button was “stuck.” It was this case!My initial review talked about the difference in my first case and the new case and to me it seemed the rubber-like, silicone-style cases were better and offered more protection during a drop. In theory that softer, rubbery, silicone style case could absorb a drop better. And I still believe that. Unfortunately, Apple or a Reddit user was able to identify the problem of people complaining of a “stuck” power button when they realized that there was one thing everyone had in common. The style of the case and the rubber that covers the button. Somehow it gets really weak and flimsy and causes that button to stay pushed in and you don’t even notice until you press and nothing happens.After reading that I did a better inspection of the case itself and noticed that it definitely looked like the part protecting the button was sunk in enough so that it was obvious this case was constantly pushing the button down. That causes the spring under the button to malfunction and it no longer springs open to push the button back out.I loved the case and will keep my original review below. I still believe it offers better drop absorption because of the way it’s made. It feels like rubber. I think of a basketball or any ball really and how they bounce off concrete. A ball made of plastic may bounce a few times but will eventually crack or break (think whiffle ball). So until all these different companies that make this style of case figure out what to do about the cover over the button, the case stops your phone from working properly so to me it’s useless. So from the Apple support or Apple employee on Reddit….avoid these cases. They will cause the power button to stay pressed which damages the spring made to push the button back out. Luckily as soon as I noticed my button “sticking” I immediately took the case off and started my Google research. After about an hour or so the spring fully bounced back and my button works fine. I went a few days with no case but the iPhone is extremely slippery without a case and it would fall out of my pocket in the car and go to that area you can’t reach until you’re stopped and can move the seat up. So I ended up putting this old, raggedy Apple case back on it. The button is still working as it should. So I’m now convinced these cases are to blame.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I’ve only had this case for about a week so I’m not sure how to rate it just yet. It’s nice so far. It’s seems pretty firm and durable. It’s made of a rubber-like substance….meaning it’s not hard plastic like most cases I’ve owned since the OG iPhone.It’s nice and clear which is what I was looking for so I’m happy with my purchase as of now. I’ve been told that the clear cases will turn like a grimey yellow. The product description stated this case will not turn that nasty looking yellowish like it smokes cigarettes all day.So for now I’m happy. It’s a little thicker than my previous case but not enough to bother me. Just taking a minute to adjust to the new feel of holding my phone. My previous case was made by Apple and magnetic so it stuck to the phone which allowed it to be thin and hardly noticeable. Unfortunately the outer part started peeling off and the case was fragile. This one seems like it is more durable for sure.If this case gets grungy yellow I will update the rating. But for now it’s what I wanted and is going the job. Just a little thicker than I like.",-1,0

I still like it though and recommend it. The buttons work great and the speaker cut outs align well. It has no grips like my $5 case but the rubbery exterior offers pretty good grip though not as much grip as my $5 case that has plastic grips that are very effective, more so than the rubber material on this unit.

This isn’t product defect, it’s just poor salesman ship, product design and trying to gain the customer for profit. It’s sleazy. It’s wrong. And it’s shameful of Amazon to accept that the vendors can get away with this. If Amazon cared about the sales experience, instead of how easy is it to get a product returned (surveys), Amazon would hire an entire team that solely focuses on fact checking, removing ambiguous or misleading verbiage and product specifications, and guiding vendors on crafting a accurate and yet still marketable product description. This in turn would most likely take a sizeable bite out of the return rate and increase the customer satisfaction and items per purchase rate given the reduced time spent navigating descriptions and having to “translate” what is being represented and whether the customer should “risk it” or not.So, this is not MagSafe. It states wireless charging acceptable but wireless charging in the Apple world is not MagSafe. I can place my phone down on a wireless charging pad or a Qi pad and wireless charging occurs.  However,  a product represented and designed for iPhone 12/ 12 pro stating wireless charging, along with a representative photo depicting a green round circle “energy” transfer, with a iPhone overhead is intentionally misleading. This is NOT MagSafe. Not close. The minute I attempted to attach my Apple MagSafe wallet or battery, it fell right off.  There’s no ring on the back.

The case does not allow my wireless Apple Airpod Pro's (Bluetooth accessory) to reliably connect to my Apple iPhone (smartphone) at all times. At first, I thought something was wrong with my Bluetooth accessory, since it would sometimes connect and then other times it wouldn't or would with a delayed connection. But upon multiple troubleshooting attempts with the Bluetooth accessory and smartphone, I decided to take off the case. The connection was immediate and reliable! I was also having trouble with my wireless charging accessory getting too hot and sometimes not connecting well. Removed the case, problem solved! The listing does not say anything about the cases Bluetooth capabilities, so no error on their part there, but it does state that it works with wireless chargers, in which I've found it does work but is not safe (gets hot) and is not reliable (sometimes doesn't charge).

ESR customer service contacted me offering to make it right by sending me a replacement case. Not at one time during the emails back-and-forth was I told or asked to please change my review once I receive the replacement case. It was being presented to me as we just want to make you happy.They tried to tell me that my purse, lotion or daylight is what caused the change in color. I don’t wear lotion on my hands very often at all. So that is not a valid argument. Also, I am not out in the daylight very often either. And I never placed my phone in my purse.The customer service representative was kind and wanted to replace the case which I appreciated, but said it was not necessary. She then said that I should have a replacement case and maybe perhaps have the case that has a black outer edge versus the clear.I really wanted to have a clear case that was a whole point to everything.After back-and-forth emailing I went ahead and said OK to replace in the case with the Black edges. However, the replacement case that was given to me doesn’t really have black edges as it is more of a transparent black. I will also insert a photo of that.But again that does not justify the yellowing of the clear which goes against their advertisement. The whole point was that I did want to have a 100% clear case.They requested that I rewrite review or delete it in to emails now. I have received two emails requesting to please change this review, but I am unable to locate that review so I shall simply post another review.They want me to leave a better review. I’m sorry I am not one that will be bought.

Not only that, but after about a year of gentle use and no drops, the sides of the case separated from the flimsy plastic back.

Then, the phone was dropped, and the screen protector cracked due to the fact that the sides of the case aren’t raised at all. Thankfully, only the screen protector was cracked. Then, only a few months later, the phone was dropped FROM A SEATED POSITION, and the back glass SPLINTERED. I am HORRIFIED. This is the WORST phone case out there, DO NOT BUY. I know that other reviews say that it’s pretty and fits perfectly, but trust me, with only a little time, this will cause you a great loss.

19483,"SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Case for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 5G (2022), Full-Body Dual Layer Rugged Case with Built-in Screen Protector &amp; Kickstand &amp; S Pen Slot (Black)",Expensive Phone Case Has Many Problems,1,"I thought that this expensive case would be great for my new phone, but it was nothing but trouble.The installation was difficult. Problems started as soon as I peeled the protective film from the back of the screen protector. Although I had cleaned the phone's screen, a bit of dust got on the back side of the screen protector, and it was difficult to remove. The front part of the case was difficult to install on the phone, and sliding it slightly into place caused the adhesive to get on the phone's screen, needing more cleaning to remove it.Quite a bit of pressure was needed to get the case to fit on the phone, which caused concern that the phone might be damaged. After repeated cycles of attempting to install the case, and repeatedly cleaning the adhesive off the phone's screen and fingerprints off the back of the screen protector,  the front of the case was in place. Installing the rear of the case was easier, since there was no screen saver or adhesive strip.Then I quickly found that the screen protector was the worst fingerprint magnet I ever had. Removing fingerprints and smears was very difficult. I used a microfiber cloth that worked perfectly on my reading glasses, but not on this case's screen protector. I tried non-alcoholic eyeglass cleaner, which was slightly better, but it still took time. The screen protector was some type of plastic that really attracted and kept fingerprint oils. Attempts to clean it resulted in the oils smearing all over it. I washed my hands before using the phone, but the screen protector still collected fingerprints, and it was just as hard to remove them.As soon as I tried the kickstand, I found that it was difficult to open, and once it was open, it was very difficult to close. I tried it many times, and each time it seemed that it would break to get it closed. So I gave up on it.Emailing support, which seemed to be the only means of contact, resulted in an immediate curt offer of replacement or refund. My two questions about what to use to clean the screen protector, and how to more easily open and close the kickstand were ignored.Another annoyance was that the S Pen compartment could not be opened when the phone was unfolded. It added the need to use more force to open and close the phone. The compartment opened when the phone opened, and it made a loud noise when it snapped shut.I found a better case for half the price, with a simple installation of the front and back portions of the case sliding in place.  No adhesive strip to make the  installation more difficult, and no spare ones to replace the original when it is worn and dust gets under the screen protector; just one easy installation of the front portion of the case. The case front is held in place by small magnets.  Its screen protector is much easier to clean, which is most important.On my new case, the S Pen compartment doesn't open when the phone is opened, and it slides open to be able to remove the pen when the phone is open. It doesn't make opening the phone harder, and it doesn't make a loud noise when the phone is closed.In conclusion, the  SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Case is seriously flawed. There is a nice video that shows how to install the case, but the actor must have practiced many times to install the case quickly, and then did not have to use the case, encountering all the problems that made it a bad choice. Believe the other negative reviews, as they are true. I seldom write reviews, but this product needed one.",-1,0

It's been in my sweatpants (not tight jeans) pocket 2-3 times per day, sitting on my desk, or charging on the Magsafe charging disc on my nightstand--and it's falling apart.  I thought that if it did fall apart it would be months, but 5 days?  This is totally unacceptable for $49+.  Also, I purchased this as a replacement to the Apple Magsafe clear case that I had for 3 months (that one took a tumble and shattered at the corners and inexplicably bent around the volume buttons, rendering it unusable--it did protect the phone!).

This is a solid case, however, its two main downfalls are how slippery it is to hold, and how easily it cracks. These two issues seem to feed into each other and I found the phone frequently, and easily, slipping out of my hand and cracking upon impact with the ground. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Apple case due to the premium materials and strong magnets, cosmetically, the case has become a nightmare. With these issues in consideration, not to mention the more expensive price, I no longer recommend the Apple clear case with magsafe.[RECOMMENDED CASE for iPhone 13 Pro Max]If anyone is looking for a case that is similar to this listing but has magsafe functionality, feels amazing to hold, and is extremely durable against fall damage, I highly recommend the case linked below:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DNWYB44/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This case is cheap and has alleviated ALL of the issues I encountered with the CASEKOO and Apple brand cases. This case is similar to the CASEKOO case in that it has soft plastic edges with a hard plastic backplate, however, the overall construction of the case is much thinner AND has magnets. Due to the thin design it is extremely pleasant to hold and the soft plastic sides of the case make it extremely easy to grip. This case makes my phone feel extremely solid and premium in my hand, and I have no doubts it will be able to withstand fall damage - unlike my apple case. If there is a con to point out with the new listing it may be that the magnets do not appear to be as strong as the ones found in my Apple case, but with that being said, magsafe is still functional across all of my accessories.CASE RANKINGS:1) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DNWYB44/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1(Best case overall, magsafe functionality, thin, durable, Brand: MP mypole)2) Apple Clear Case with Magsafe(most expensive, premium materials, fragile and does not withstand fall damage)3)CASEKOO(Does not support magsafe, thicker)*********ORIGINAL REVIEW (9/25/21)**********************Be careful if you buy this case as it does not work well with magsafe accessories. If you plan on using a magsafe car mount or charger such as the Belkin Boost 3-in-1, this case is NOT compatible. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is a heavy phone, and because this case does not have additional magnets the magnetic connection was extremely weak and my accessories were unable to support the weight of my new iPhone.Overall, the construction of the case is fairly nice. I like the hard plastic back plate, but it is prone to showing a lot of finger prints, even when using lighter variations of the phone such as the new Sierra Blue color. The soft plastic edges of the case are nice and they provide a bit of grip to the phone while maintaining the tactile feel of the buttons, but they also make it feel more bulky and cheap. Additionally, the pattern embedded into the soft plastic, along with the air cushions on the corners of the case obstruct the view of the stainless steel edges of the phone.I really wanted to love this case, and as soon as I unboxed my phone I immediately put it on. However, I was extremely disappointed to discover how poorly it worked with my new magsafe accessories. If magsafe is not important to you I think this is a cheap and solid buy, but it will mean you won't be getting the most out of your new investment.I just purchased the Apple Clear Case with Magsafe, and as soon as I started using it the difference in quality was immediately apparent. Though this case is more expensive ($49) I think it is well worth the money, and it is exactly what I was looking for. This case looks better, feels better, and is more functional. This case is constructed entirely out of hard plastic and shows absolutely no finger prints or smudges, and the additional magnets mean it works perfectly with my new accessories. Because of the hard plastic I don't think this case will hold up as well to drops, but it looks and feels amazing.",-1,0

The case does not go all around the phone (like an Otter) so I will be throwing it away (I already threw out the packaging, my fault)!I am not sure if I installed it correctly, but mine does not have a front cover nor do the instructions reference one.  As far as the ""glass"" protector, there is a thin piece of something (plastic) that appears to sit on the front, but it certainly doesn't provide any protection, removes super easily and water can easily get into the phone.

I think it is a design flaw for the silicon case to have such a thin lip around the case edges. I do like the feel of the case and it is very light. I talked with Apple customer support today and sent them pictures. They said they’d contact me within a week and let me know if they can replace the case for no charge. This was the first time I purchased an official Apple brand case and I am disappointed with the workmanship. The otter box and non Apple bumper cases are much less expensive and are more durable and probably give better protection.,-1,0

The volume buttons easily move under my fingers when I press them.  I especially don't like that.  If the buttons were more substantial, sturdy, a bit larger, and didn't move when I pressed them, or shook the case when the phone was out of it, this wouldn't be a bad case.

The case corner will pull back very slightly on the corner and flip off the ringer switch. I called Apple and they said they'd let their engineers know but no joy on a return as they don't consider it broken. If you get this case, handling the phone, or putting it in your pocket will make you miss calls. It turns off all the time. If not for that it's fine. But this issue is very, very frustrating.The case seems durable enough. I've only had it on for a couple of days. I don't put much wear on cases anyway, the phone doesn't move a lot.The magsafe is quite strong. That's the reason I got it, as I wanted the magnet to be good.

Two things I don’t like.  It shows lots of fingerprints.  Maybe a cloudy clear option would solve that issue for me.  The second thing is that the case barely sticks to my MagSafe charger.  I bought a stand that holds the magnetic charger in an upright position while charging.  The magnet isn’t strong enough through this case to hold it upright.  As long as the phone is laying flat on the charger, it will charge.  I would return this case for that reason, but I’ve already thrown out all of the packaging.

For the money, you get a case, two screen protectors and two camera protectors. I had a clear case that was starting to yellow and was out of screen protectors for my iPhone 13. I was especially interested in finding a camera protector because I dropped my phone a while back and luckily didn’t hurt the actual camera but I did scratch the metal ring that borders the camera and since I’m stuck with this phone under contract with my cell company, I wanted it to be protected from future damage. You can buy all three (case, protectors, camera protectors) separate but I came across this package that had all three and for under $20!! It came beautifully packaged and had the screen protector guide so you don’t worry about getting it crooked, which some screen protector packs don’t come with. It had lovely packaging and had a thank you card, some cute stickers even and a lifetime product guarantee! I loved everything about it except within a week, the camera protector had cracked! I did not drop my phone or otherwise would have caused the crack so I’m not sure what caused it. Other than that issue I’m very happy and so far everything else has been great.

It fit the Z Fold 4 snug and felt like it made it more durable for sure. It does add quite a bit of extra heft/bulk to the phone, but that's to be expected with an armored case.The first thing I noticed right away was the ""tackiness"" of the front cover screen. After removing the films, it provides a little grip on the front screen from the protector. Not enough to be a nuisance or collect debris, but enough to be discouraging to me as I prefer a tempered glass feel that gives a lovely glide of the finger. The screen protector is a plastic that's thicker than film, but not hard; just enough flexibility.The second thing was the S Pen holder. It appears to have a small ""pocket"" where you would think to insert the pen and snap into place. If you do that with the S Pen Fold edition, then it makes it require much more force to ""eject"" the pen, enough to where it was a bit concerning. I found that snapping the pen into place above that ""pocket"" would allow the pen enough clearance still to snap in and eject with ease. So, be aware of this.Lastly for my concern was wireless charging. Folded and placed on my Qi charging pad, there were no issues, it immediately recognized and began quick charging. Opened/Unfolded, the device has a large hinge guard/pen holder along the back. This is great for added grip to the device, but not so great to provide a surface to allow wireless charging. You can get it to work with some adjusting, but you can't simply toss it on there, and you cannot get it to rest open in the standard car mounts. You would need to use this folded closed in most any car mount.Other than those concerns, the case felt very protective. It provides a nice little pop out finger grip/stand. Gives added front screen protection. Fits great and allows access to buttons. Houses the S Pen along with guarding the hinge.Overall, I did end up going with something else as I wanted to have more wireless charging capability unfolded/open in the car.",0,1

To reinsert the phone you push it (obviously) this turns the flash light on. Or the camera on. Or turns the customize screen on.

6687,OTTERBOX COMMUTER SERIES Case for iPhone 12 &amp; iPhone 12 Pro - BLACK,Important buttons,3,I’ve always gotten Otterbox cases for every one of my iPhones. When I had number 3 it fell off the top of my car (I left it there and got in and drove away) on the on ramp on a throughway going 40mph. Tracing my steps I found it at the base of a concrete barrier next to the throughway. The screen was fine. The case had some scrapes and gouges on a couple of the corners. It was definitely still useable. The iPhone worked fine except the sound was “crunchy” for a while then it just stopped and never came back. I was happy that I had it and it worked. I can’t remember the name of the model but it was the heftiest one. Without that case my iPhone would have been garbage. The case was worth every penny and then some. I have an iPhone 12 now. I decided to go with a level or so below the heftiest model - this one. It was very nice. I could tell it had that same quality the last several Otterbox cases I’ve owned. I’m not sure if it was a problem in production or whatever but I had a hard time pushing the buttons on the sides - all of them. When I did push them I wasn’t sure if they were engaged or not so I’d press them again sometimes making choices I didn’t mean to. I gave it a few weeks thinking that I had to wear them in but they never changed. I had to send it back. Then some financial bologna happened and I couldn’t afford much of anything at the time so I had to go with a cheaper case. This weird thing happening does in no way make me think badly of Otterbox or their products. I am definitely going to be investing in another Otterbox in the future.,0,1

I called Apple and they said they'd let their engineers know but no joy on a return as they don't consider it broken. If you get this case, handling the phone, or putting it in your pocket will make you miss calls. It turns off all the time. If not for that it's fine.

I originally bought it to showcase the color of my phone and was pleased with the overall quality for the price when I first got it. I have found 2 issues with this case so far:1. One major downside to this case is that you have to use the glass screen protectors that come with the case. None of my other universal glass protectors fit with the case because it is a slightly different size. As far as I've researched, you can't buy extra glass from them if the 2 that come with it shatter eventually.2. The case is described as super anti-yellowing but 1 month in and I can tell the difference. I've taken the case off once and can see the yellowing of the clear plastic already as well as the beautiful purple color of my iPhone is now muted by the yellowing. I don't get my case dirty often and it is usually stored out on my desk at work (not in sunlight) or at home on my bedside table (again not in the sunlight).Other than the above, the case seems to protect my phone just as well as other cases I've had and again price is affordable.

I dropped my phone and now there is a tiny dent on the bottom of my phone, although that can be covered up by a non-clear case, but it still kind of stinks. I think the loose side of the case became even more removed from my phone upon impact with the ground, causing this dent. If you do get this case, you absolutely need to get a screen protector as well. It's a good case if you quickly need something cute and cheap for your phone, but I recommend using extreme caution until you are able to get a sturdier case.",0,1

I cannot go without a popsocket I have to have something to grip onto or else I drop my phone constantly! If you do want a popsocket on your case this is a super cute and light case that feels great! If you are wanting to put a popsocket on I would not buy this case! We tried hot glue, industrial strength glue, my husband even tried JB wield glue to stick a pop socket on the case but nothing worked! So if you want a popsocket on your case I would say pick another case!",0,1

The first thing I noticed about the buttons is how small they are.  I don't like that at all.  They are also metal which is something I don't like.  The volume buttons easily move under my fingers when I press them.  I especially don't like that.  If the buttons were more substantial, sturdy, a bit larger, and didn't move when I pressed them, or shook the case when the phone was out of it, this wouldn't be a bad case.

I originally bought it to showcase the color of my phone and was pleased with the overall quality for the price when I first got it. I have found 2 issues with this case so far:1. One major downside to this case is that you have to use the glass screen protectors that come with the case. None of my other universal glass protectors fit with the case because it is a slightly different size. As far as I've researched, you can't buy extra glass from them if the 2 that come with it shatter eventually.2. The case is described as super anti-yellowing but 1 month in and I can tell the difference. I've taken the case off once and can see the yellowing of the clear plastic already as well as the beautiful purple color of my iPhone is now muted by the yellowing. I don't get my case dirty often and it is usually stored out on my desk at work (not in sunlight) or at home on my bedside table (again not in the sunlight).Other than the above, the case seems to protect my phone just as well as other cases I've had and again price is affordable.

These always seem just a bit slippery, and this falls square in to that category.I prefer the ""rounded"" edge of the iPhone 11 Pro.

To add, extended single hand use becomes painful (blunt squared corner) in the palmPulling this case out of pockets results in the silicone clinging to your cloth pockets turning inside out.The case edge protrudes (1mm) over the glass edge requiring more deliberate (precise) swipes across the screen edges.Adhesive ""stick on"" accessories like pop-sockets will NOT adhere to this silicone case.",0,1

As others have noted the pen case does prevent wireless charging when the phone is open. You also have to manually close the pen case when you close the phone. The wireless charging is a problem as I try to keep the phone open as much as possible.  I had the fold 3 until it cracked along the internal screen fold without being dropped. I  wish you could remove the pen case as I don't even have the pen.What is more disturbing to me is that the kickstand and phone holder will no longer stay extended by itself. It collapses as soon as you try to prop the phone up. You can still put your finger through to hold the phone but I expected the case to stand up to daily use for the price. As other reviews have mentioned there is no metal on this case. For the price the company would probably still make money if it was made of aluminum or had metal parts.  The integrated screen cover for the small outside screen is a nice feature but it also a fingerprint magnet.The rest of the case seems sturdy and protective except for the phone stand/holder which lasted less than a month.

19474,"SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Case for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 5G (2022), Full-Body Dual Layer Rugged Case with Built-in Screen Protector &amp; Kickstand &amp; S Pen Slot (Black)",High price case that falls flat,3,I purchased this case on 10/05/22 and have had it on my phone everyday since it arrived.  As others have noted the pen case does prevent wireless charging when the phone is open. You also have to manually close the pen case when you close the phone. The wireless charging is a problem as I try to keep the phone open as much as possible.  I had the fold 3 until it cracked along the internal screen fold without being dropped. I  wish you could remove the pen case as I don't even have the pen.What is more disturbing to me is that the kickstand and phone holder will no longer stay extended by itself. It collapses as soon as you try to prop the phone up. You can still put your finger through to hold the phone but I expected the case to stand up to daily use for the price. As other reviews have mentioned there is no metal on this case. For the price the company would probably still make money if it was made of aluminum or had metal parts.  The integrated screen cover for the small outside screen is a nice feature but it also a fingerprint magnet.The rest of the case seems sturdy and protective except for the phone stand/holder which lasted less than a month.  All things considered ibwouldbnot buy this case again...it's just not worth the price.,0,1

For the money, you get a case, two screen protectors and two camera protectors. I had a clear case that was starting to yellow and was out of screen protectors for my iPhone 13. I was especially interested in finding a camera protector because I dropped my phone a while back and luckily didn’t hurt the actual camera but I did scratch the metal ring that borders the camera and since I’m stuck with this phone under contract with my cell company, I wanted it to be protected from future damage. You can buy all three (case, protectors, camera protectors) separate but I came across this package that had all three and for under $20!! It came beautifully packaged and had the screen protector guide so you don’t worry about getting it crooked, which some screen protector packs don’t come with. It had lovely packaging and had a thank you card, some cute stickers even and a lifetime product guarantee! I loved everything about it except within a week, the camera protector had cracked! I did not drop my phone or otherwise would have caused the crack so I’m not sure what caused it. Other than that issue I’m very happy and so far everything else has been great.

It is functional and provides all-around protection. It’s a case that works for around $10 with the coupon.It does have a great fit and fully protects the case. I have not dropped the phone yet. If a drop impacted the corner or sides, I would be confident that the case and the phone would emerge without damage. If a hard drop happens, the polycarbonate front or back would likely shatter leaving the phone undamaged, or maybe with a few ver minor scratches. This would make me very satisfied with the case as the purpose is to protect the phone, cases are much cheaper than a new phone or repairs.The feel of the side bumpers is not fantastic, but not uncomfortable. I would have preferred a softer silicone feel. The front screen protector is prone to collecting fingerprints, more so than the screen of the phone without the protector. The screen remains quite responsive with the protector and Face ID does work. The screen has a plastic feel and is not made of explosive proof glass. Installing the phone was easy, as with any case just make sure to spend the time to clean the phone and case thoroughly. Be extra vigalent to look at the phone screen from multiple angles to spot and remove any dust with the dust sticker.I removed one star for the misinformation about the case being made of glass. If the case was advertised as polycarbonate, I would have still purchased it and been happier.The second star was removed due to the way the case feels. Softer bumpers with more grip would have made for a much better case. I also question the scratch resistance of the plastic feel of the screen protector.

The upside is that it won't slip out of your hands or off a surface easily. The downside, which for me is significant, is that the case makes it really hard to put your phone in or take it out of your pocket. It sticks to the fabric in your pocket on the way in and you really have to push hard and jiggle it to get it down to the bottom of your pocket. And then once it's in your pocket, getting it out takes effort and will pull whatever else is in your pocket out with your phone.As a protective device, this is a fine case.

It fit the Z Fold 4 snug and felt like it made it more durable for sure. It does add quite a bit of extra heft/bulk to the phone, but that's to be expected with an armored case.The first thing I noticed right away was the ""tackiness"" of the front cover screen. After removing the films, it provides a little grip on the front screen from the protector. Not enough to be a nuisance or collect debris, but enough to be discouraging to me as I prefer a tempered glass feel that gives a lovely glide of the finger. The screen protector is a plastic that's thicker than film, but not hard; just enough flexibility.The second thing was the S Pen holder. It appears to have a small ""pocket"" where you would think to insert the pen and snap into place. If you do that with the S Pen Fold edition, then it makes it require much more force to ""eject"" the pen, enough to where it was a bit concerning. I found that snapping the pen into place above that ""pocket"" would allow the pen enough clearance still to snap in and eject with ease. So, be aware of this.Lastly for my concern was wireless charging. Folded and placed on my Qi charging pad, there were no issues, it immediately recognized and began quick charging. Opened/Unfolded, the device has a large hinge guard/pen holder along the back. This is great for added grip to the device, but not so great to provide a surface to allow wireless charging. You can get it to work with some adjusting, but you can't simply toss it on there, and you cannot get it to rest open in the standard car mounts. You would need to use this folded closed in most any car mount.Other than those concerns, the case felt very protective. It provides a nice little pop out finger grip/stand. Gives added front screen protection. Fits great and allows access to buttons. Houses the S Pen along with guarding the hinge.Overall, I did end up going with something else as I wanted to have more wireless charging capability unfolded/open in the car.",0,1

When new, this was great. The tactility and grip were excellent and wasn't too ""grabby"". After about a full month, the outer layer has worn off somehow and is now way too grabby. I usually put my phone in my back pocket and several times with a car key fob when moving around to unload things. Well, being so grippy now, when the phone gets pulled out, of course the keyfob comes with it and ends up on the ground!  I've had two close calls where I almost lost the fob, so I'm not taking anymore chances with this case and have since discontinued use and discarded. NOT recommended for those who pocket their phones as it will pull the entire pocket fabric inside/ out on jackets or loose fitting clothin, along with whatever else may be inside.Original review:These soft silicone overmolded cases with a hard inner liner are seemingly difficult to find, especially for a decent one online. Feels like I got lucky with this, as it’s not the typical thick silicone that’s floppy and ill-fitting and stretches at the worse times resulting in a case that slips off!These case it just the right thickness and has an additional lip around the camera area for added drop protection, should your phone fall camera down. Buttons are still easily accessible and offer good tactility, while not being too firm. My last case had buttons that were too soft and bulged a bit too much, resulting in frequent accidental shutting down the screen and locking the phone.After about a week’s worth of use, the silicone has gotten grippier and is starting to pull my pockets inside out at time! Not a big deal…Love the lack of billboarding on the exterior of the case and can only be seen on the inside microfiber lining. I loved it so much, I ordered another one, since the lighter colors usually discolor and I plan on keeping my phone for about another year. Great case at a fair price with quality fitment!",0,1

My favorite part is the microfiber inside the case - I know it's for extra cushion and protection but it just makes the case feel FANCY, the way women wear fancy underwear to feel fancy even if no one can see from the outside.

I have a magsafe bracket in my car that holds my phone and this will not stick to it or the one next to my bed. useless if it does not stick. If they fix that issue, I'd give it 5 stars, but since I now need to find a solution to this, in finding a ring that is flat that will stick to the back of the case to make magsfae actually work as a magsafe connection.Don;t call it magsafe if it does support the magnetic part. all this should say is it supports wireless charging. but don't say it supports magsafe it if does stick to the magsafe pad.",0,1

As others have noted the pen case does prevent wireless charging when the phone is open. You also have to manually close the pen case when you close the phone. The wireless charging is a problem as I try to keep the phone open as much as possible.  I had the fold 3 until it cracked along the internal screen fold without being dropped. I  wish you could remove the pen case as I don't even have the pen.What is more disturbing to me is that the kickstand and phone holder will no longer stay extended by itself. It collapses as soon as you try to prop the phone up. You can still put your finger through to hold the phone but I expected the case to stand up to daily use for the price. As other reviews have mentioned there is no metal on this case. For the price the company would probably still make money if it was made of aluminum or had metal parts.  The integrated screen cover for the small outside screen is a nice feature but it also a fingerprint magnet.The rest of the case seems sturdy and protective except for the phone stand/holder which lasted less than a month.

19622,"SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Case for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 5G (2022), Full-Body Dual Layer Rugged Case with Built-in Screen Protector &amp; Kickstand &amp; S Pen Slot (Black)","Great protection, but limits functionality...",3,"I had purchased this case direct from SupCase, as it's $20 cheaper than the listing here.Upon receiving the case, it was very sturdy feeling! It fit the Z Fold 4 snug and felt like it made it more durable for sure. It does add quite a bit of extra heft/bulk to the phone, but that's to be expected with an armored case.The first thing I noticed right away was the ""tackiness"" of the front cover screen. After removing the films, it provides a little grip on the front screen from the protector. Not enough to be a nuisance or collect debris, but enough to be discouraging to me as I prefer a tempered glass feel that gives a lovely glide of the finger. The screen protector is a plastic that's thicker than film, but not hard; just enough flexibility.The second thing was the S Pen holder. It appears to have a small ""pocket"" where you would think to insert the pen and snap into place. If you do that with the S Pen Fold edition, then it makes it require much more force to ""eject"" the pen, enough to where it was a bit concerning. I found that snapping the pen into place above that ""pocket"" would allow the pen enough clearance still to snap in and eject with ease. So, be aware of this.Lastly for my concern was wireless charging. Folded and placed on my Qi charging pad, there were no issues, it immediately recognized and began quick charging. Opened/Unfolded, the device has a large hinge guard/pen holder along the back. This is great for added grip to the device, but not so great to provide a surface to allow wireless charging. You can get it to work with some adjusting, but you can't simply toss it on there, and you cannot get it to rest open in the standard car mounts. You would need to use this folded closed in most any car mount.Other than those concerns, the case felt very protective. It provides a nice little pop out finger grip/stand. Gives added front screen protection. Fits great and allows access to buttons. Houses the S Pen along with guarding the hinge.Overall, I did end up going with something else as I wanted to have more wireless charging capability unfolded/open in the car.",0,1

I originally bought it to showcase the color of my phone and was pleased with the overall quality for the price when I first got it. I have found 2 issues with this case so far:1. One major downside to this case is that you have to use the glass screen protectors that come with the case. None of my other universal glass protectors fit with the case because it is a slightly different size. As far as I've researched, you can't buy extra glass from them if the 2 that come with it shatter eventually.2. The case is described as super anti-yellowing but 1 month in and I can tell the difference. I've taken the case off once and can see the yellowing of the clear plastic already as well as the beautiful purple color of my iPhone is now muted by the yellowing. I don't get my case dirty often and it is usually stored out on my desk at work (not in sunlight) or at home on my bedside table (again not in the sunlight).Other than the above, the case seems to protect my phone just as well as other cases I've had and again price is affordable.

As others have noted the pen case does prevent wireless charging when the phone is open. You also have to manually close the pen case when you close the phone. The wireless charging is a problem as I try to keep the phone open as much as possible.  I had the fold 3 until it cracked along the internal screen fold without being dropped. I  wish you could remove the pen case as I don't even have the pen.What is more disturbing to me is that the kickstand and phone holder will no longer stay extended by itself. It collapses as soon as you try to prop the phone up. You can still put your finger through to hold the phone but I expected the case to stand up to daily use for the price. As other reviews have mentioned there is no metal on this case. For the price the company would probably still make money if it was made of aluminum or had metal parts.  The integrated screen cover for the small outside screen is a nice feature but it also a fingerprint magnet.The rest of the case seems sturdy and protective except for the phone stand/holder which lasted less than a month.

It is functional and provides all-around protection. It’s a case that works for around $10 with the coupon.It does have a great fit and fully protects the case. I have not dropped the phone yet. If a drop impacted the corner or sides, I would be confident that the case and the phone would emerge without damage. If a hard drop happens, the polycarbonate front or back would likely shatter leaving the phone undamaged, or maybe with a few ver minor scratches. This would make me very satisfied with the case as the purpose is to protect the phone, cases are much cheaper than a new phone or repairs.The feel of the side bumpers is not fantastic, but not uncomfortable. I would have preferred a softer silicone feel. The front screen protector is prone to collecting fingerprints, more so than the screen of the phone without the protector. The screen remains quite responsive with the protector and Face ID does work. The screen has a plastic feel and is not made of explosive proof glass. Installing the phone was easy, as with any case just make sure to spend the time to clean the phone and case thoroughly. Be extra vigalent to look at the phone screen from multiple angles to spot and remove any dust with the dust sticker.I removed one star for the misinformation about the case being made of glass. If the case was advertised as polycarbonate, I would have still purchased it and been happier.The second star was removed due to the way the case feels.

It’s a sturdy case with decent corner protection and shock absorption. Overall, happy with its functionality. The downside is, the clear case is marketed as “Anti-Yellowing” which in my opinion is one of the most important qualities for anyone seeking a crisp, clear case for their iPhone. Unfortunately, although it is marketed as such, this is not the case. It’s took a little over 1 month to start seeing a mild yellow tint around the border of the phone case. I know this is expected from most clear cases but what I really don’t appreciate is shady marketing. Referring to the product as “Anti-Yellowing” when you know that it does indeed become yellow is a misleading sales tactic that doesn’t encourage return customers. Solid functionality, but if you’re looking for “that” clear case, this item doesn’t check all the boxes.",0,1

It is very difficult to remove the magnet ring from the Magnasafe charger.

Heck,I've dropped my phone even MORE trying to pull my phone out of my pocket with this case on it, lol. And despite the 'quality', silicone rubber is silicone rubber. It's a **lint magnet**.

The volume buttons easily move under my fingers when I press them.  I especially don't like that.  If the buttons were more substantial, sturdy, a bit larger, and didn't move when I pressed them, or shook the case when the phone was out of it, this wouldn't be a bad case.

6682,OTTERBOX COMMUTER SERIES Case for iPhone 12 &amp; iPhone 12 Pro - BLACK,Otterbox Disappointment!,3,"I recently needed a new phone case for my phone. I knew so many people that spoke so highly of Otterbox phone cases. I decided I would try one. I ordered this case. My observations are:It’s a very sturdy phone case! Part of the case comes over the front of the phone acting as a “bumper” so the glass screen never really gets a chance to touch the ground. It is incredibly durable! It also has a cover for where the charger plugs into the phone (offering even more protection). I have no doubt this is a great phone case!Why did I only give it a three star rating?As in the description, it talks about rubber grips to help you hold the phone case where it won’t slip out of your hand as easily. I can feel the different texture, but I think it slips just as easy as any other phone case I have used. Also, the part of the case that covers the charging port on the phone, makes it much more difficult to plug in the charger. I also didn’t really like the fact that the phone cases are not decorative in any way. I find I get tired of the same color all the time! Boring! Then, my biggest complaint is the fact that the case is SO durable that I can barely push any of my buttons (power, volume, screenshots, etc.)! I used the case for a few weeks thinking it would ease up, but it hasn’t! I can barely push those buttons on my phone!Unfortunately I didn’t keep the packaging this case came in, or I would have returned it. I’ve ordered a different case that I think I will like better.

Not too big of a deal unless you are sitting next to a sleeping baby.Lastly, the ring isn’t tight enough.

It’s a sturdy case with decent corner protection and shock absorption. Overall, happy with its functionality. The downside is, the clear case is marketed as “Anti-Yellowing” which in my opinion is one of the most important qualities for anyone seeking a crisp, clear case for their iPhone. Unfortunately, although it is marketed as such, this is not the case. It’s took a little over 1 month to start seeing a mild yellow tint around the border of the phone case. I know this is expected from most clear cases but what I really don’t appreciate is shady marketing. Referring to the product as “Anti-Yellowing” when you know that it does indeed become yellow is a misleading sales tactic that doesn’t encourage return customers. Solid functionality, but if you’re looking for “that” clear case, this item doesn’t check all the boxes.",0,1

When new, this was great. The tactility and grip were excellent and wasn't too ""grabby"". After about a full month, the outer layer has worn off somehow and is now way too grabby. I usually put my phone in my back pocket and several times with a car key fob when moving around to unload things. Well, being so grippy now, when the phone gets pulled out, of course the keyfob comes with it and ends up on the ground!  I've had two close calls where I almost lost the fob, so I'm not taking anymore chances with this case and have since discontinued use and discarded. NOT recommended for those who pocket their phones as it will pull the entire pocket fabric inside/ out on jackets or loose fitting clothin, along with whatever else may be inside.Original review:These soft silicone overmolded cases with a hard inner liner are seemingly difficult to find, especially for a decent one online. Feels like I got lucky with this, as it’s not the typical thick silicone that’s floppy and ill-fitting and stretches at the worse times resulting in a case that slips off!These case it just the right thickness and has an additional lip around the camera area for added drop protection, should your phone fall camera down. Buttons are still easily accessible and offer good tactility, while not being too firm. My last case had buttons that were too soft and bulged a bit too much, resulting in frequent accidental shutting down the screen and locking the phone.After about a week’s worth of use, the silicone has gotten grippier and is starting to pull my pockets inside out at time! Not a big deal…Love the lack of billboarding on the exterior of the case and can only be seen on the inside microfiber lining. I loved it so much, I ordered another one, since the lighter colors usually discolor and I plan on keeping my phone for about another year. Great case at a fair price with quality fitment!",0,1

The colors and design were exactly as pictured, even a bit better than I expected. The back was a matte fog look that was really neat, with the floral details raised up with a clear finish, and it didn’t look like they could be scratched off easily. The border had a silky silicone feel. Not a fan of the yellow buttons, but I understand their appeal. I also wasn’t sold on the individual holes on the bottom speaker, as I figured that requires a lot of precise measurements to not interfere with the mic and speakers.Now, why I ended up returning it came down to how thin and flimsy the sides of the case are. I was concerned about dropping my phone and breaking my brand new screen protector, or even the phone itself. The edges of the case aren’t raised enough to protect the screen, and there aren’t even bumpers on the corners.

When new, this was great. The tactility and grip were excellent and wasn't too ""grabby"". After about a full month, the outer layer has worn off somehow and is now way too grabby. I usually put my phone in my back pocket and several times with a car key fob when moving around to unload things. Well, being so grippy now, when the phone gets pulled out, of course the keyfob comes with it and ends up on the ground!  I've had two close calls where I almost lost the fob, so I'm not taking anymore chances with this case and have since discontinued use and discarded. NOT recommended for those who pocket their phones as it will pull the entire pocket fabric inside/ out on jackets or loose fitting clothin, along with whatever else may be inside.Original review:These soft silicone overmolded cases with a hard inner liner are seemingly difficult to find, especially for a decent one online. Feels like I got lucky with this, as it’s not the typical thick silicone that’s floppy and ill-fitting and stretches at the worse times resulting in a case that slips off!These case it just the right thickness and has an additional lip around the camera area for added drop protection, should your phone fall camera down. Buttons are still easily accessible and offer good tactility, while not being too firm. My last case had buttons that were too soft and bulged a bit too much, resulting in frequent accidental shutting down the screen and locking the phone.After about a week’s worth of use, the silicone has gotten grippier and is starting to pull my pockets inside out at time! Not a big deal…Love the lack of billboarding on the exterior of the case and can only be seen on the inside microfiber lining. I loved it so much, I ordered another one, since the lighter colors usually discolor and I plan on keeping my phone for about another year. Great case at a fair price with quality fitment!",0,1

The upside is that it won't slip out of your hands or off a surface easily. The downside, which for me is significant, is that the case makes it really hard to put your phone in or take it out of your pocket. It sticks to the fabric in your pocket on the way in and you really have to push hard and jiggle it to get it down to the bottom of your pocket. And then once it's in your pocket, getting it out takes effort and will pull whatever else is in your pocket out with your phone.As a protective device, this is a fine case.

Two things I don’t like.  It shows lots of fingerprints.  Maybe a cloudy clear option would solve that issue for me.  The second thing is that the case barely sticks to my MagSafe charger.  I bought a stand that holds the magnetic charger in an upright position while charging.  The magnet isn’t strong enough through this case to hold it upright.  As long as the phone is laying flat on the charger, it will charge.  I would return this case for that reason, but I’ve already thrown out all of the packaging.

It is functional and provides all-around protection. It’s a case that works for around $10 with the coupon.It does have a great fit and fully protects the case. I have not dropped the phone yet. If a drop impacted the corner or sides, I would be confident that the case and the phone would emerge without damage. If a hard drop happens, the polycarbonate front or back would likely shatter leaving the phone undamaged, or maybe with a few ver minor scratches. This would make me very satisfied with the case as the purpose is to protect the phone, cases are much cheaper than a new phone or repairs.The feel of the side bumpers is not fantastic, but not uncomfortable. I would have preferred a softer silicone feel. The front screen protector is prone to collecting fingerprints, more so than the screen of the phone without the protector. The screen remains quite responsive with the protector and Face ID does work. The screen has a plastic feel and is not made of explosive proof glass. Installing the phone was easy, as with any case just make sure to spend the time to clean the phone and case thoroughly. Be extra vigalent to look at the phone screen from multiple angles to spot and remove any dust with the dust sticker.I removed one star for the misinformation about the case being made of glass. If the case was advertised as polycarbonate, I would have still purchased it and been happier.The second star was removed due to the way the case feels. Softer bumpers with more grip would have made for a much better case. I also question the scratch resistance of the plastic feel of the screen protector.

It feels a little looser than the leather of previous generations, but it’s good enough and I had no issue with it popping out of the phone.  After 3 months of use, the corners are showing some wear.  The matte finish becomes semi-gloss.  This doesn’t bother me however.  One good thing about silicone case is that it doesn’t slip out of my pocket like the leather one does.

It works well, all the potential ways for water to get in are covered either by thin layers of plastic over the speakers or this thin silicone like film on the ringer button, I also like that it has a raised edge for the camera and also plastic covering the lenses themselves. The only downside is the screen is difficult to tap and texting for the first 2 weeks was a nightmare because i would have to tap really hard for the phone to recognize that I was tapping it, because the screen on the front and back is made of plastic/some sort of see through material. Also it makes your phone record audio really poorly so it literally sounds like I'm mid battle, especially if I am holding the phone in my hand since the speakers are covered by the thin plastic, and it picks up your finger movement. Also the silicone like material over the ringer button I am constantly afraid that my nails will break it, since you really have to dig in there to get the button to move, it will likely tear with usage. I did really like the little wrist thing that comes with it so you can hang your phone from your wrist, Overall not bad, I'm not super picky, but if the audio and the tapping the screen really hard will bother you I don't recommend it. I personally wouldn't buy it again, but since I already bought it I will use it until it gets super worn ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1,2

Most cases around that area are soft and cannot maintain their shape because it's very thin.I like the button and voice holes and the buttons are very responsive.

This case fits the bill. I love how it looks on my phone, and though I was worried about the color of the part of it that covers the camera area, it didn't take away from the appearance at all - and the holes all aligned perfectly.There are only 2 things that I would prefer be different, but they don't affect my rating at all. The first is the buttons. The plastic over the buttons does not stick out very far at all, seemingly a good thing. In practice, I like being able to feel the buttons a little better than this case allowed. Pretty much a personal preference since they still performed fine, but I felt like I lost a little bit of touch. Nowhere near as bad as another case I have for another phone that drives me insane, being both too flat and close to impossible to push. These work. The other thing is 100% me, probably wouldn't bother another soul. I actually don't particularly care for the little inner cutout on the back of the phone (an extra design cut around the edge of the phone and going around the the cameras). I'd prefer for it all to be uniform since this kinda adds an extra element to the phone design that isn't actually there. Just me.None of the above affects my rating. I didn't try to drop my phone while I had this case on it (I just see no need to tempt fate), but it seems decent. It is raised around the screen, so that's great. All in all I like it a lot.",1,2

The pictures don’t do it justice. The quality of the print is so clear & it has a cool texture to it that feels like it’ll last and be durable in case of any falls. The feeling of the case itself is kind of rubberized, so feels higher quality than just regular hard plastic. There’s also a little hole to loop a wrist lanyard through if you like that.

24857,Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro Silicone Case with MagSafe - Black,Fantastic Case!,5,"I bought this case directly from apple rather than off Amazon. They had a next day free shipping thing going on and I wanted to make sure I got an authentic one. I have to say this was a good decision. I have always bought the 3rd party cheaper cases for my phones and this was the 3rd case I had bought for my iPhone 12 pro. I should have just bought this first.Pros:- It looks perfect. All buttons and cutouts align perfectly. The camera cutout is beveled so it doesn’t even look like a cutout. It all just looks like it is the phone rather than a case for the phone. Being my first true apple case I am simply amazed. I can see why they charge so much. It’s not worth $50 but it is worth more than others.- It feels amazing. They say it’s silicone but it doesn’t feel like any silicone I have touched. To me it feels kinda like fine felt. It’s the only way I can explain it. It’s weird but in a good way. Not rubbery at all.- It connects perfectly to the apple MagSafe charger. It also charges just fine on my regular non magnetic wireless charging stand.- I also bought the Belkin MagSafe car vent mount and it connects perfectly to that too. It doesn’t work with other round vent mounts though. I didn’t expect it to but just to confirm. The magnets on those mounts just don’t align to the MagSafe magnets. Different sizes. You could probably glue one of the metal plates to the inside of this case. It would work but that’s just crazy talk.Anyway, I am very happy with the case. I decided to write this review even though I didn’t buy it off Amazon just because I was on the fence and hesitated for weeks due to the handful of negative reviews. You don’t need to hesitate. Just debate on color.",1,2

 I applied the screen protector and boy! It was easy and perfect! No effort, just simply using the tools that came with it and no bubbling happened, which I was mostly afraid of b/c of some of the negative comments that I saw. The only disappointment I have is that the product went on sale only 1 day after the package arrived. I almost wanted to return it and repurchase it.As far as the case, I haven’t used it yet but compared to the one I already have on my phone, it’s about 40% thinner. It is not the most definite protective case out there but protective enough with care. I sure have maintained many iPhones in good condition with cases like that for 3+ years each. Although I feel much safer using my current case, I would still recommend it for those who take good care of their phones and are looking for budget friendly cases.Other than that, very well and nicely packaged.

24174,Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro Silicone Case with MagSafe - Black,"Quality case, high-end feel, minimal protection",4,"I bought the deep navy silicone case for my iphone 12...color is as advertised (great).  It's a perfect case for those who want a minimalist case with a quality, high-end feel.  My favorite iphone was the 5 because of the squared edges, so I was looking for a slim case with a minimalist feel that allows you to feel the edges. I did not get the leather because I read it was a bit more ""slippery"" than the silicone and wanted a more secure grip.  The silicone texture has a soft, fine brushed feel to it which is very pleasing.  Protection is average to low, but I believe that is on purpose.  You can't have max protection with a slim/minimalist case.  The edges of the case barely come over the front screen but the cutouts and buttons are nice. My only complaint is the price, which is quite high.  But it's Apple and you're paying for the name and the quality.  If you can get past that, you'll certainly be pleased.",1,2

It's as described,  well protective. I always try to get the most protective case for my phones. It was disappointing to find that Otterbox didn't offer the same protection as this pro bettle case. I read the reviews and people said they were annoyed by the pen cover staying open and that you had to manually shut it. It's not annoying at all. This case just feels right. It feels sturdy and protected. I noticed the price come down recently on this about 20 dollars less than I paid. Which is surprising because I feel the quality is there.

24847,Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro Silicone Case with MagSafe - Black,"Protects phone, but might not last longer than a couple months to a year",4,"I’ve had this phone case in color black. Though it’s comfortable in hands, has a snug fit, and the button keys are still accessible, the silicon on the edges of the case may peel. When I first recieved the case, it chipped in some corners of silicon. Within months, it’d spread and broken, causing large chunks. Tonight, no later than maybe 8 months after I recieved, the volume button casing finally came off. It’d been fine this entire time, just these past couple days slowly peeling. I have dropped the phone more than once, on flat surfaces, and zero cracks or scratches. It’s been a good wall of protection, but the quality of the cosmetics and exterior are bare minimum for this price. I’d expect much more for a nearly $50.00 phone case. I probably won’t get this same one again unless I can’t find an alternate material.",1,2
10667,"MOZOTER Magnetic for iPhone 13 Case &amp; iPhone 14 Case,[Compatible with Magsafe] [Anti-Yellowing] [3 Pcs Glass Screen Protectors] Shockproof Phone Case Cover 6.1&#34;,Clear","Great case, lots of accessories, but…",5,"This is a great case, fits perfectly, non-slip, extra screen protectors, really cool camera lens protectors too. The only issue I have is it doesn’t always charge using the inductive method. With the case on, this will not seat fully in my Silverado’s charging well on the top of the center console. My old iPhone 11 Pro-max had the same issue, but the phone would still charge even though it wasn’t fully seating. This case will not allow it. On my home charging pad, I have to repeatedly reposition it until it just barely “connects.” I’m using a high quality charging pad too. Not sure what I’ll do now, I like the case a lot, but not being able to charge it wirelessly while I’m in my vehicle isn’t going to work for me, and I don’t understand why it isn’t connecting up well with my home pad. Surprising, since there seems to be a circular “magnet or something” embedded in the case back, I assume to improve charging. If you plug your phone in to charge, by all means this is a great buy. But if you like to use the inductive charging, your mileage may vary.UPDATE: Mozoter reached out to me about my difficulties getting the inductive charging to work through the case and they sent me a different case, this one clear, and I tried this one and it works much better for charging. So I’ve updated my rating to 5 stars because this company cared that I was satisfied and they DO make a great case for your iPhone. I would definitely purchase another case from this company.",1,2

Now that we got that out of the way and explained the star loss, let's get to the good part.I've dropped this, a lot, with zero issues to the phone. My kids, 4 and 6, have dropped it, stepped on it once (32lbs) and it is still standing!I like that the hinge is fully protected by the s pen holder which BTW ONLY fits the Fold version of the S pen NOT the Pro, I tried lol. This design won't allow you to lay the phone flat when open but it gives me a grip for my hand which feels natural and I like and is a pro from me.Overall, the case feels solid, the layout of buttons are spot on and the fit around the phone is snug with no silly adhesive strips like other cases have which I like. I take my phone out of it's case a few times weekly to wipe it down, etc.The kickstand is solid and a nice bonus feature. I am happy with this case.",1,2

Absolutely in love,5,"‼️Stop and read because it is definitely worth the purchase! I originally bought this phone case because I broke my Apple MagSafe silicone case. First off, the Apple silicone case was so cheaply made. I searched for cheap clear cases and saw this case specifically that came with a protector for both the screen and camera lenses. I thought “Okay this is such a good deal!” It got delivered right away and from the packaging, I was a bit skeptical because it was thin to have all these products. But as soon as I opened it, I was in for a full surprise! They gifted stickers which was nice, it came with 2 screen protectors, 2 camera lens protectors, the case, a magnetic ring and wipes and stickers for application. Everything was packaged nicely. From the screen protector, I was impressed that it was a glass protector as well as the camera lens protector. But the case OH MY GOODNESS! The case was crystal clear and it fit so snug on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I love how it hugs the phone and the sides of the case isn’t flimsy to pull on. If you’re looking for a case to buy, this is the one to get. Plus you get the bonus protectors! Definitely worth it.",1,2

The thinness & quality of the case is exactly alike as the Apple one.Couple of days later:The only con I have noticed while having this case for a couple of days is that the silicone on the volume buttons doesn’t have that PC material covering it (the layer that’s under the silicone). It’s just the silicone and it’s all flappy and loose on that spot, which is annoying. Had to deduct the score to a 4 star because of that. Other than that, they nailed making this case making it almost identical and budget friendly than the iPhone Silicone Case.Elago knows what they’re doing.Save your money!",1,2

After looking over all the cases recommended on different sites for my new phone, I stumbled upon this one. For my prior phone I had purchased a Ghostex case that I liked, but the case yellowed.This case is not only a better price, the materials are of equally high quality and, if it follows, it won't yellow. The case also came with two screen protectors. The screen protector is really easy to apply and comes out wonderfully. I do recommend you take all the pieces out of the box first, as I didn't find the plastic tool that helps smooth the protector down, until too late and ended up with a couple bubbles.There are application directions in the box that include a video you can view online that shows you in more detail. The video is great, but a little too fast and it first looked like the applicator used to smooth the screen protector down was behind the screen protector. That was my mistake. Had I taken everything out of the box first, I would have discovered it in the box, but it would have been nice if the video had included an image of all the pieces to apply the screen protector on the table around the phone first, before showing how to apply it.There is also a piece of plastic to attach to the base of the phone to line up the screen protector while applying it that kept it straight--this was really nice. Great value and really nice quality. I would recommend this case for those looking for a basic clear military grade case instead of paying more for a popular brand. Thank you Humixx . I'm a fan!",1,2

All three snap together, unlike the Otterbox which just press fits together.This could be a problem for anyone who needs to remove their case from time to time for use in cell phone holders for video or photography. Which I do occasionally.Removing my phone from the Otterbox wasn't too much of a pain.This one on the other hand might take some work, and the little snaps that hold things together don't look like they'll hold up to much off and on action.If you need to remove your case often, I would pass on this case.If you're like most people, you'll never need to remove the case once it's on.

The difference between the two cases is the DEFENDER has the impact-absorbing rubber all around the *outside* of the case and I believe it to be a bit superior for that reason. I still recommend the COMUTER, but if you have say, kids that possibly play with your phone or you yourself are always dropping or banging it around, you might want to consider the DEFENDER by Otterbox instead",1,2

I am concerned about affecting the clarity of photos with a lens cover. The lip of the Mkeke case will not allow the lenses to touch the surface of a table etc.I do not think 14 Pro Case manufacturers did their homework to find out how very far these new lenses stick out!The lip surrounding the front frame of the phone is also high enough to protect the front of the phone.

The thinness & quality of the case is exactly alike as the Apple one.Couple of days later:The only con I have noticed while having this case for a couple of days is that the silicone on the volume buttons doesn’t have that PC material covering it (the layer that’s under the silicone). It’s just the silicone and it’s all flappy and loose on that spot, which is annoying. Had to deduct the score to a 4 star because of that.

The hearts are scratching off but the big strawberries are still intact. No biggie!When I opened the package it indeed came with a screen protector that matched my phone, but unfortunately it had a black outline that would cover the white of my phone. I ended up tossing that out so, bummer.Ever since day 1, taking pictures or videos with flash would have a sort of pink film over them. There’s a part of this case that casts the pink over the flash and I just think that’s a molded error. It doesn’t mess me up all that badly but if taking daily videos with flash is your thing, it might mess you up.Overall the case has miniature details that is always appreciated when you carefully look at your phone.

From age, after a year of use, the firm plastic edging cracked at the base, however, my phone was still well protected I think. I highly recommend this case to others and feel it is such a good price.  Shipping was speedy, too.  Oh.. AND it came with 2 screen protectors which are MUSTS for iPhones!  It feels great in my hands as well.",1,2

I worked a lot with my hands in a kitchen and always had my phone in my apron pocket so that’s probably why. I used the clear case so I could put my little sketches I felt in the moment in between. The case got so bad even after cleaning I decided to toss it.I ran into this one while searching for clear/jelly phone cases and saw some positive reviews on it, the case was on sale (I bought it before Christmas 2022) so I bought it.I’m very pleased with it. I’m a little clumsy so when I look for cases I mainly look for reviews on protection against drops, this so far is great. I work in a warehouse and have dropped my phone a few times on the concrete floor, it’s done well. I also don’t fancy cases that are solid colors or are clunky, so visually it checked off all my boxes. The buttons are protected very well too! I can fit a picture or a little sketch if I want and it does great, no transfer of ink. Now the problem I had with my last case, the BAD yellowing. I can’t tell if this is starting to turn yellow, I use this as my main case and clean it regularly. To some it might be like OH MY GOD END OF THE WORLD, but if it turned yellow I wouldn’t be mad or upset, this case has protected my phone well and that’s what I care about! So 5/5 for me my dudes.",1,2

 This is a very nice phone case. The clear case shows my new phone nicely. I am excited to hear that it is non-yellowing to protect this great hue. As for protection, before I decide to buy it, I was afraid that it is too slim to protect my iPhone. They raised the screen lips and camera lips and there is protection around the 4 corners to protect the phone from dropping on the hard surface. The clear case shows the original color and beauty perfectly and the hard back helps to withstand shocks. The case has a hard back but soft sides. The soft sides provides a grip so that your phone does not slide out of your hands.The case is very easy to clean and it doesn’t seem to attract fingerprints and smudges.The phone case is smooth, lightweight, and has a sleek design with a secure grip. Its design allows for a strong grip while still allowing me to slide my future phone into and out of my pocket easily. Also, the slim and lightweight profile of the case does not add any bulk. Very good price for the quality you are getting!I am happy with my choice and TORRAS never disappoint! Highly recommend!！I love their cases",1,2

The iPhone 11 I bought is the lilac color and we wanted to be able to show off the beautiful color of it so a clear case would be perfect.This set comes in a hard plastic case.  Inside the case is the hard plastic frame, the TPU case, 2 glass screen protectors, and everything necessary to install the screen protector.  The hard plastic frame is a bit difficult to detach from the TPU case but it does come out with careful removal.IMPORTANT - Install the case before trying to install the screen protector.  The frame comes over the edges and can push the screen protector off the screen when installing it.  Also, with the case installed, it makes it really easy to install the screen protector evenly.We are very happy with this case.  It provides a lot of protection without taking away from the phone.  The buttons work perfectly and the cut outs are wide enough to allow clearance for the charging cable.  Clear screen protectors are also great if you want to cut out your own images and put them on the inside facing out.",1,2

11518,"COOLQO Compatible with iPhone 11 Case, and [2 x Tempered Glass Screen Protector] for Clear 360 Full Body Coverage Hard PC+Soft Silicone TPU 3in1 Shockproof Protective Phone Cover",Install screen protector after installing case,5,"I recently purchased new phones for everyone and needed cases for them all.  The iPhone 11 I bought is the lilac color and we wanted to be able to show off the beautiful color of it so a clear case would be perfect.This set comes in a hard plastic case.  Inside the case is the hard plastic frame, the TPU case, 2 glass screen protectors, and everything necessary to install the screen protector.  The hard plastic frame is a bit difficult to detach from the TPU case but it does come out with careful removal.IMPORTANT - Install the case before trying to install the screen protector.  The frame comes over the edges and can push the screen protector off the screen when installing it.  Also, with the case installed, it makes it really easy to install the screen protector evenly.We are very happy with this case.  It provides a lot of protection without taking away from the phone.  The buttons work perfectly and the cut outs are wide enough to allow clearance for the charging cable.  Clear screen protectors are also great if you want to cut out your own images and put them on the inside facing out.",1,2
