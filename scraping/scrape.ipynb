In the short time that I used it, the hardware and software mostly worked well.* Software updates are provided for the device and apps.Cons:* Considering that its a paid product, the amount of ads / recommendations is high. Its possible to tone them down, but not to remove them.* Sleep does not work with desktop monitor. Screen always stays on.* Stick format makes it hard to remove and add to different devices.* A bit slow to use. Third party apps are generally slower and can be buggy.* The level of customization available is low.

Just make the permanent price 2.5 to 3k. Btw I bought it for 2.8k\\n\", '\\nI have an Samsung Smart TV which was 4-5 yrs old and hence it did not received new updates of various OTT platforms. Also many OTT apps were not available on the samsung smart store. Fire Stick completely changed the game and viewing experience. Even the Picture quality had improved to a great extent as the TV now runs on Firestick software instead of the TV.
